# StarGAN for Image-to-Image Expression Translation
---------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction 
StarGAN, is a novel and scalable approach that can perform image-to-image translations  for  multiple  domains  using  only  a  single  model.Such a unified model architecture of StarGAN allows simultaneous training of multiple datasets with different domains within a single network. This leads to StarGANâ€™s superior quality of translated images. In this paper I use the StarGan architecture for expression synthesis by generating new images with different expressions from a single image.
